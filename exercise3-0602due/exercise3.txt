1.Telnet HTTP Conversations:
	1.1. 	type "telnet www.cs.sfu.ca 80" in terminal
		 	then paste in:
			 	GET /~ggbaker/470e3/ HTTP/1.1
				Host: www.cs.sfu.ca
				Connection: close
		the status code the server response is: 200
	1.2.If-modified-since
			if paste in: 
				GET /~ggbaker/470e3/ HTTP/1.1
				Host: www.cs.sfu.ca
				If-modified-since: Mon, 1 May 2017 00:00:00 GMT
				Connection: close
		the status code is: 304 (not modified)
		this indicate that is not the first time that I make this specific request, therefore it has been cached and is not modified since last time I made the request
	1.3.Redirect
			I typed in:	
				GET /~ggbaker/470e3 HTTP/1.1
				Host: www.cs.sfu.ca
				Connection: close
		the status code is: 301 (moved permanently)
		the different result is because when you add the slash at the end, the server will look for a directory named 470e3, and most servers do not then try to find a file name of that name. so if make request without slash, server will not to find this directory

2.Command-Line Requests
	2.1.GET http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ggbaker/470e3/

	2.2.GET -esS http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ggbaker/470e3/
		(I have to enter a blank line?)

		if add "-esS", this allows us to receive response headers along with content (not like only html content when withou -esS)
		
3.Developer Tools
