Make a simple webpage with these following markup:

Markup 1

Consider this passage, which you might want to mark up using HTML:

According to Wikipedia, there was never a version 1.4 of HTML. The W3C is the World Wide Web Consortium, and it defines HTML.

Choose an appropriate HTML tag for each of the three highlighted words, according to their meaning in that passage. Have a look at the HTML reference pages for tags that match their meaning. The default rendering (in most browsers) for the tags I think are best are all italic text: they will all look the same (give or take the browser's default CSS), but the markup you choose will expand their meaning to search engines, screen readers, etc. (Hint: <cite>, <dfn>, and one other.)

Add a paragraph to your content.html file that contains the above passage; mark it up as described above. There is no need to create a stylesheet to make the words look like the above: this question is only about content. [Note that the default rendering of <dfn> in Chrome isn't italic: that doesn't matter since we don't care appearance here.]

Markup 2

Have a look at each of these tags in an HTML reference: <ol>/<li>, <abbr> (with a title), <dl>/<dt>/<dd>.

Add some content to your content.html that uses each of these tags appropriately. (i.e. Create some content that matches the meaning of those tags, to demonstrate that you know what they are and how to use them properly.)
